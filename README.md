This app was built using [Trace AI](https://trace.zip), and you can demo this particular project at [https://trace.zip/c/4bc1503e-fa6f-4c53-9363-452e4fe2cd9e](https://trace.zip/c/4bc1503e-fa6f-4c53-9363-452e4fe2cd9e).

## Building the App

To build the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Xcode project file.
3. Build and run the app on an iOS simulator or a physical device.

## App Structure

The app is structured into the following main components:

1. **ContentView**: This is the main view of the app, which contains a TabView with five tabs: Explore, Wishlists, Trips, Inbox, and Profile. The Explore tab contains the MapView, which displays the search bar, categories list, and map view.

2. **SampleView**: This is a placeholder view used for the other tabs (Wishlists, Trips, Inbox, and Profile). It simply displays a "Sample View" title.

3. **MapView**: This view contains the search bar, categories list, and map view. The search bar allows users to search for locations, and the categories list displays a horizontal list of categories with icons. The map view displays the selected region.

## Code Explanation

The code imports the SwiftUI and MapKit frameworks and defines the ContentView, SampleView, and MapView structs. The ContentView struct initializes the appearance of the UITabBar and defines the body of the view, which contains a TabView with five tabs. Each tab has a corresponding view and a label with an icon.

The SampleView struct simply displays a "Sample View" title. The MapView struct defines the search bar, categories list, and map view. The search bar is implemented using a Button with an HStack containing an Image and Text. The categories list is implemented using a ScrollView with a horizontal HStack containing Buttons with VStacks for the category icons and titles. The map view is implemented using the Map view from the MapKit framework.

The ContentView_Previews struct provides a preview of the ContentView for the Xcode preview pane.
